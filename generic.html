					<p>Smoking is expensive. In fact, the amount of money you spend on smoking may surprise you. 
•Multiply how much money you spend on tobacco every day by 365 to see what you spend every year on smoking.
•Now multiply that by the number of years you have been using tobacco.
•Then, multiply the cost per year by 10 for the upcoming 10 years.

If you’re a one-pack-per-day smoker, you’ll probably save over $15,000. Ask yourself what you would rather do with that much money! 

There are other financial benefits, too. You’ll pay less for health and life insurance. You’ll incur fewer costs due to tobacco-related problems, medical bills, and frequent trips to the doctor. 

If you quit smoking, you will also decrease the chance of fatal fires and serious burns. And because you aren’t making late-night trips to the store for cigarettes, you’ll gain more freedom and time – the cost of which can be immeasurable. 

</p>
					<p>The cosmetic benefits of quitting smoking can be a major motivator, especially when you consider the unpleasant short- and long-term effects smoking has on how you look. 

When you quit smoking:
•your breath will smell better
•stained teeth will get whiter
•your clothes and hair will smell better 
•your fingers and fingernails will no longer look yellow 
•you’ll have better oral health
•you’ll have a better chance for fewer skin wrinkles
</p>
					<p>Because your skin and teeth will look better, you may start to look younger. A study from the University of Zurich even found a correlation between gray hair and being a smoker – chemicals may damage cells in hair follicles or constrict the blood vessels that supply them. They can also constrict blood vessels in the face, leading to a yellow pallor and a breakdown in elasticity – and that can happen in the 20s in the same way it happens to someone in their 30s. 

The good news is, quitting can start to reverse the signs of an aging face within two weeks.
